## Introduction

**Synapse Engine** is a lightweight and flexible game engine designed for creating 3D games. It offers a robust set of tools and features to help developers bring their game ideas to life. With a modular architecture and support for multiple platforms, Synapse Engine is ideal for indie developers and larger studios alike.

**Key Features:**
- Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Lightweight
- High-performance rendering with OpenGL
- Integrated physics engine with bullet physics engine
- Support for implementing custom physics engine or proprietary physics engine (Ex. Havok, PhysX)
- Asset management system
- Implement your own rendering backends (Ex. Vulkan, DirectX, etc.)
- Multithreading support
- Pure ECS (Entity Control System) Approach & Scene Management System
- Standalone editor (SynapaseEditor)
- And more!

## Getting Started

To start using Synapse Engine, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- CMake 3.10 or later
- Git

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up Synapse Engine:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/derpy588/Synapse-GameEngine.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd Synapse-GameEngine
   ```
3. **Build the engine:**
   ```bash
   scripts/managev2.sh build
   or
   scripts/managev2.sh release
   ```

I may release the package for each platform in the future, but I am not sure because doing cross compiling is difficult and tedius and rather spend time making and improving the engine so for the time being you should compile the library from your computer.

Once built, you can explore the engine by running a sample project. Check the `examples` directory for specific instructions.
**Note** that there currently are no examples but plan to implement them later.
