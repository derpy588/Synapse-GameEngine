# SynapseEngine Roadmap

This file defines the different systems I am currently and planning to implement. 

## V1.0.0 Roadmap

### Phase 1 Checklist
- [X] Logging system
- [ ] Memory Management
- [ ] Math Library
- [ ] Window Management & Abstraction
- [ ] Input Management & Abstraction

### Phase 1: Core Foundation
1. Logging System
Start with logging since it will help debug everything else. Implement:

Basic logger with console and file output
Log levels (trace, debug, info, warning, error, critical)
Thread-safe logging mechanisms
Category-based filtering

2. Basic Memory Management
Create memory allocation systems that will support all other engine components:

Custom allocators for different usage patterns
Memory tracking for debugging
Pooled allocators for frequently created/destroyed objects

3. Math Library
Build or integrate a math library that supports:

Vector and matrix operations
Quaternions
Transform operations
Collision detection primitives

4. Window Management & Input Abstraction
Establish the connection to the operating system:

Cross-platform window creation and management
Input handling (keyboard, mouse, controllers)
Basic event processing from the OS

### Phase 2: Rendering Foundation
5. Graphics API Abstraction
Create a layer that abstracts away specifics of graphics APIs:

Unified interface for multiple backends (OpenGL, Vulkan, DirectX)
Resource management (textures, buffers, shaders)
State management and render command submission
Basic render pipeline setup

6. Basic Renderer
Implement core rendering functionality:

Mesh rendering
Material system
Basic lighting
Camera systems

### Phase 3: Architecture Components
7. Event System
Now that you have logging and basic rendering to visualize results, implement:

Type-based event dispatcher
Event queuing mechanisms
Thread-safe event processing
Integration with window events from Phase 1

8. ECS (Entity Component System)
Create your core game object architecture:

Entity management
Component storage and access
System processing framework
Component serialization

9. Scene Management
Build the organizational structure that will use your ECS:

Scene graph structure
Spatial organization
Scene loading/saving
Integration with the ECS

### Phase 4: Gameplay Systems
10. Physics Integration
Add physics capabilities:

Rigid body dynamics
Collision detection and resolution
Integration with the ECS
Physics debugging visualization

11. Resource Management
Create a system to handle game assets:

Asset loading pipeline
Resource caching
Hot-reloading support
Asset reference counting

12. Audio System
Implement sound capabilities:

Audio playback
3D positional audio
Integration with event system
Sound resource management

### Phase 5: Advanced Systems
13. Animation System
Build support for bringing objects to life:

Skeletal animation
Animation blending
Integration with the ECS
Animation event system

14. Multithreading Framework
Enhance your architecture with proper threading:

Job system for task parallelization
Thread-safe communication between systems
Dedicated render and AI threads as planned
Synchronization mechanisms

15. UI Framework
Add support for interfaces:

2D rendering for UI elements
UI component system
UI layout management
Input processing for UI

### Phase 6: Tools & Refinement
16. Basic Editor Functionality
Begin implementing the tooling:

Scene editor core
Entity inspector
Property editing
Simple gizmos for manipulation

17. Serialization System
Create a robust system for saving/loading:

Component serialization/deserialization
Scene serialization
Prefab/template support
Version management for saved data

18. Profiling & Debugging Tools
Add systems to help optimize the engine:

Performance metrics
Visual debugging tools
Memory usage tracking
System statistics visualization

### Phase 7: Expansion & Completion
19. Advanced Rendering Features
Enhance visual capabilities:

Post-processing pipeline
Shader system expansion
Particle systems
Advanced lighting models

20. AI Systems
Implement your dedicated AI thread functionality:

Pathfinding
Behavior trees
Decision making
Navigation mesh generation

21. Networking (Optional)
If needed, add multiplayer capabilities:

Client-server architecture
State synchronization
Networked physics
Network event system
